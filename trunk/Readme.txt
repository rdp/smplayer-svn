    SMPlayer intends to be a complete front-end for MPlayer, from basic
    features like playing videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more advanced features
    like support for MPlayer filters and more.

    Well, you've probably read the rest in the web, haven't you?

    To know how to compile and install smplayer please read Install.txt.

    There's available an optional package called smplayer-themes. It contains
    some icon themes for smplayer and it's highly recommended that you install

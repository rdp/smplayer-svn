Description: A great front-end for MPlayer
 SMPlayer intends to be a complete front-end for MPlayer, from basic features
 like playing videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more advanced features like support
 for MPlayer filters and more. One of the main features is the ability to
 remember the state of a played file, so when you play it later it will resume
 at the same point and with the same settings. smplayer is developed with
 the Qt toolkit, so it's multi-platform.
